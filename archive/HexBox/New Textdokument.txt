<b>Figure 1 </b>(A) The prototype from planks, (B) Box components (C-D-E) Connections – dowels

The inspiration is taken from timber dome structures, where solid timber walls were built from planks, connected side by side. Furthermore, the research is based on a collaboration with a local timber company located in a mountain area. In this context, timber has a low economic value because the price no longer covers the harvesting cost. Therefore, there is a need to explore the available timber stock (round wood, beam elements and planks) to transform it locally. The geometry modelling workflow is split into three parts: surface discretization, joint modelling and fabrication. Firstly, projection-based solver is applied to the planarization of volumetric blocks. Secondly, the joint geometry is computed according to the insertion vector and a tool-path is generated using G-Code to guide the 4.5 Axis CNC machining. As proof of concept, two prototypes were built, one from planks and another from round-woods. The choice of material influenced the segmentation of the timber shell. Finger and Tenon-mortise joinery techniques have been chosen for their simple modelization and fast cutting time. Their placement follows as closely as possible fiber orientation of wood. Even if both study cases share the same discretization method, the first prototype from timber plates takes advantage of lightweight structures, while the second explores a heavy solid round-wood structural system.

<b>Research Interest - Wood from Mountain Timber Forestry</b>
The research project is related to a larger mountain forestry study (tree species – Épicéa), CNC fabrication tool and wood-wood connection development within a CAD interface (see Fig. 2 A1-A5). Economically, local mountain forestry no longer covers operating costs due to complicated harvesting process: a crane and a cable system is needed to carry tree trunks from high to low altitude of mountains and then transported them to large saw-mills far from a cutting area. To reduce this expensive cycle, there is a preference to investigate novel building systems made from harvested trees and apply them locally. 

<b>Modelling Framework</b>
The CAD modelling workflow (see Fig. 2 B1-B5) is based on a surface subdivision, discretization, planarization, joinery geometrical specification, CNC fabrication and assembly sequence. Two building materials are assessed from the local saw mill: planks and round-wood. The design target is a surface that is discretized according to building material scale and assembled manually using wood-wood connections. It considers geometrical and material constraints: linearity of wood, grain direction, drying and fabrication processes.  The tool is based on a mesh modelling framework in order to have a low-poly representation of panels and timber blocks. In addition to this, the model itself has two representations: a 3d model and a fabrication tool-path.

The planarization method is based on support structures of polygonal cell packing [5]. The aim is to compute polyhedrons, which are solids with only planar face boundaries from arbitrary surface subdivision [6]. Similar research [7] implemented plane projection methods on quad meshes with small gaps at each mesh vertex. Other possibility is to use Voronoi diagrams for planarization [5]. Another technique is to apply a circle packing of triangle meshes whose incircles form a packing [8]. A third method uses circular and conical meshes [9].
Our chosen polygonal pattern does not have such qualities because its shape is linked to the linearity of planks and round-wood. The aim is therefore, to keep the original shape without too much distortion. The proposed planarization method is based on an iterative solver which gradually projects extruded quad faces to an average plane (see Fig. 3). The user has to specify a tolerance of a planar polygon and give a collection of mesh vertex points. While iterating through polygonal mesh faces, the current mesh face vertices are projected to an average plane and the non-planar polygon deviation is recorded. Afterwards the average sum of projected mesh face vertices are assigned to current mesh face vertices. This method is re-iterated multiple times until the deviation is below the user specified tolerance value.
The full modelling framework is subdivided into the following steps (see Fig. 4 C): the target surface is discretized into a polygonal mesh. The mesh edges are extruded and planarized (see Fig. 4 A). The top and bottom contours of each cell are not planar and are therefore, projected to the average plane of their vertices (see Fig. 4 B). Projected points form a planar polygon and, together with planarized quads, result in a planar polyhedron.

<b>Prototypes</b>
A series of prototypes was made to validate the planarization algorithm. Two models are detailed in the following subsections (3.1 and 3.2). Planks and round-woods were specifically chosen as part of a collaboration between a local forestry company and the research institute to use raw timber materials. Consequently, it was important to understand the relationship between material, connection geometry, assembly sequence and fabrication.

Several existing publications describe the automation of assembly path that influences the joinery geometry (type of joint and an insertion direction) [10, 11, 12]. It is also possible to look at this problem from a user perspective when the assembly path is already known. Proposed methodology is based on the existing state-of-the-art method [7] and extended to polygonal meshes, which are not restricted to triangle or quad discretization. Moreover, graph-search methods such as Breadth-First-Search could be applied to compute an assembly order (see Fig. 7). Edges of this graph whose nodes are polygon centers give insertion direction. This vector has to be compared against connected edge direction to know if the insertion vector is not parallel. BFS is a fast approach when a user does not have a sequential order how to assemble elements one after another. Other methods such as a grid-like assembly could be applied when the initial topology is regular. Lastly, several large patches could be assembled together too. It often requires special details, as multiple edges may not have uniform insertion vector applicable to all elements within a group.  

A series of box-to-plates transformations are made after the planarization. First, we get the insertion range based on neighbor faces (see Fig. 5 A) and second, the insertion angle is computer based on element faces and fabrication constrains (a maximum CNC cutting angle 45°; see Fig. 5 B). Third, we compute the intersection between the two sets of angles A ∩ B (see Fig. 5 C). Then, turn each polygonal face into a 3D geometry, with plate-to-plate and box-to-box connections. The insertion direction is used to compute tenon-mortise joints at the top and bottom edges. Edge-wise dovetail joints are chosen for each side.  To prepare the cutting files, polylines are oriented from the 3D space to the 2D plane of the wooden board. The G-Code is exported for 4,5 Axis CNC fabrication and when fabrication is finished, individual plates are assembled into boxes. Finally, a set of boxes are connected using dowels (see Fig. 6).
