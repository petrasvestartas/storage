<b>Introduction to computational architecture (AR-327)</b>

<b>Summary:</b>
This course reviews the basics of 3D modeling to establish the foundations of parametric architectural modeling via different methods. The main objective of the course is to develop a computational mindset to maximize the use of efficient digital tools in architectural projects.

<b>Content:</b>
This course is composed of 3 modules:
3D modeling (CAD) where the fundamentals of geometry are reviewed and advanced techniques of 3D modeling are covered (2 weeks).
Parametric modeling (visual scripting, Grasshopper) where the parameterization of basic and advanced geometric elements is studied (5 weeks).
Computational modeling (scripting) where an introduction to coding is given (5 weeks).
This configuration in 3 modules allows to gradually increase the level of complexity and to initiate architecture students to computational thinking.

<b>
By the end of the course, the student must be able to:</b><b><b></b></b>
Identify the different modeling techniques
Classify these techniques by their degree of efficiency
Develop simple parametric models with Grasshopper
Develop and execute low-level Python scripts for 3D modeling
Propose an appropriate method to build a model
Transversal skills
Use a work methodology appropriate to the task.
Plan and carry out activities in a way which makes optimal use of available time and other resources.
Use both general and domain specific IT resources and tools
Demonstrate the capacity for critical thinking
Teaching methods
Lectures (1/3 to 1/2 of each session)
In-class tutorials (1/2 to 2/3 of each session)
Expected student activities
Participation during the course
Pro-active attitude for class exercises
Independent realization of exercises after each week
Assessment methods
An evaluation is done at the end of each week with an exercise to be handed in for the following week on the theme studied. Each test has the same coefficient in order to obtain a continuous control throughout the course.
