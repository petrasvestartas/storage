Why? But does it float? + Lightweight structure + Transparency</i>

Lumos - a spell used to conjure a small light in J.K.Rowling's "Harry Potter"

This is a building where elegance and lightness is achieved through the balance between transparency and privacy. This balance is reached by designing a facade shell, which is translucent - meaning it lets trough the light, while omitting the view. This way actual windows are left with only one function - framing the outside view, thus decreasing the necessity of them to a bare minimum. The triangular hole in the front of the building which is aligned towards the sky creates a sensation of flight while also bearing the function of privacy assurance. A see-through stripe in the bedroom frames a closeup of surrounding nature. While long range views are calming and inspiring, closeups are curious and substantive. This building invites to experience them both.
Just like the spell from the book of "Harry Potter" with its faint glow this building becomes a guide for those who are lost at night. It resembles a lighthouse by a miniature sea.
